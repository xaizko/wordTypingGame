# 📚 Typing Game - Terminal Based Speed Typing Challenge 🚀

## Overview
This is a terminal-based typing game that tests your speed and accuracy! The game fetches random words from an API and challenges you to type them within a time limit.

## 🌟 Features
- 💨 Time-based typing challenges
- 🔤 Random word generation via API
- 📊 High score tracking
- 🎮 Simple terminal-based interface
- 🎨 Colorful text feedback

## 🛠️ Technologies
- C programming language
- libcurl for API requests
- File I/O for score persistence
- Terminal manipulation with ANSI color codes

## 📝 What I Learned

### 🔌 Working with APIs
- How to make HTTP requests in C using libcurl
- Processing JSON responses from web APIs
- Managing network failures gracefully
- Parsing and manipulating API response data

### 🧮 Pointer Management
- Proper memory allocation and deallocation
- Using function pointers for dynamic behaviors
- Avoiding segmentation faults through null checks
- String manipulation without buffer overflows
- Pointer arithmetic for efficient data processing

### 🕹️ Game Development Concepts
- Input timing and user interaction
- Score tracking mechanisms
- Menu systems and game state management
- Terminal-based UI implementation

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- GCC compiler
- libcurl development libraries

### Installation
```bash
# Install dependencies
sudo [package manager] curl

# Compile the game
make

# Run the game
./typingGame
```

## 🎮 How to Play
1. Select game mode from the menu
2. Enter the time limit per word
3. Type the displayed words as quickly as possible
4. Your score increases based on word length
5. Game ends when time runs out or you make a mistake

## 🧠 Future Improvements
- Add multiplayer mode
- Implement more challenging word categories
- Create a global leaderboard
- Add sound effects and more visual feedback
